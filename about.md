Hello, my name is Rayhan Mursalin. I am a junior web developer. I mainly work with Front end languages but learning some back end languages as well. I spend most of my time learning web technologies by breaking and fixing things. I enjoy travelling and taking pictures. Maintaining healthy lifestyle by eating clean and working out is very important to me.
